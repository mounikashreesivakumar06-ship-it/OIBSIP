## ATM Interface

## About the Project

ATM Interface is a console-based ATM simulation application developed using Java as part of the **Oasis Infobyte Java Development Internship**.

The application simulates the basic functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). Users can securely authenticate using their User ID and PIN and perform common banking operations such as checking their balance, depositing money, withdrawing money, transferring funds, and viewing transaction history.

The project is designed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles with multiple Java classes to provide a structured and maintainable application.

## Features

- User ID and PIN authentication
- Maximum of 3 incorrect PIN attempts
- Secure access control
- ATM main menu
- Balance inquiry
- Cash deposit
- Cash withdrawal
- Fund transfer
- Transaction history
- Transaction tracking
- Input validation
- Account management
- Logout functionality
- User-friendly console interface

## ATM Operations

After successful authentication, the user can access the following operations:

### 1. Transaction History
Displays the user's previous banking transactions.

### 2. Balance Inquiry
Displays the current available account balance.

### 3. Deposit
Allows the user to deposit money into their account.

### 4. Withdrawal
Allows the user to withdraw money from their account after checking the available balance.

### 5. Transfer
Allows the user to transfer money to another account.

### 6. Change PIN
Allows the user to change their PIN.

### 7. Logout
Allows the user to securely exit the ATM session.

## Authentication

The application provides a secure login mechanism using:

- User ID
- PIN

The user is allowed a maximum of **3 incorrect PIN attempts**. Access is denied if the user exceeds the maximum number of attempts.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **Java Collections**
- **Console-based Application**

## OOP Concepts Used

The project demonstrates several important Object-Oriented Programming concepts, including:

- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Abstraction
- Methods
- Constructors
- Data management using objects

## Project Structure

The project contains the following Java files:

### `Account.java`
Manages account-related information such as account details and balance.

### `ATM.java`
Handles the main ATM functionality and user interaction.

### `Bank.java`
Manages bank accounts and banking-related operations.

### `Transaction.java`
Represents and stores transaction details such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

### `Main.java`
Contains the main method and starts the Smart ATM application.

## How To Run
Open the project folder in Command Prompt or Terminal.

## Compile the files:
javac*.java

## Run the program:
java Main
